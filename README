Project 7: Concurrent bags
-------------------------------

Study and implement the bag data structure from HÃ¥kan Sundell, Anders Gidenstam, Marina Papatriantafilou, Philippas Tsigas: A lock-free algorithm for concurrent bags. SPAA 2011: 335-344.

For baseline performance, compare against a simple (own)
sequential implementation with locks on all operations.


  make small-bench

Runs a small benchmark that takes approximately 1 minute to finish. The
results are stored time-stamped in data/.

  make small-plot

Produces two plots of the small benchmark data. It automatically chooses
the latest timestamped run in data/.

Prerequisites
-----------------------------

What is needed:

* C compiler
* GNU Make
* Python version at least 3.6
